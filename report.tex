\section{Introduction (1-3 pages)}
ElasticFusion on the Google Tango Tablet\\
The Dyson Robotics Lab has recently purchased a set of Google Tango Tablets that come as an integrated Android-based platform equipped with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) colour camera, a fisheye monochrome camera, as well as a depth camera that uses projection of an infrared pattern. 

This makes it an ideal setup for deployment of RGB-D SLAM algorithms, such as ElasticFusion [T. Whelan, S. Leutenegger, et al. RSSâ€™15, IJRR'16], which we recently published. This will need, however, some adaptations to the algorithms and software. While this project is very challenging, it is also rewarding, since the aim is to develop a fully self-contained dense mobile 3D scanning solution.\\
